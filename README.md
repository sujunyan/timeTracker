# Time Tracker 
This is a time tracker for my personal use. Previously I used some apps to record how long I work every day. But those apps are not supported for exporting data and I want to draw some fancy graphs myself. So I am thinking of develop my own one.

This "app" is python based and I want to keep it simple and neat. It is now command line based. I am currently not sure if I want to add a simple GUI...

# Data Analysis 

## Print statistics summary

## Plot pie chart

## Plot timeline

## Plot working time along date/month
